Experiment starts with a corpus selection 

then we have to select from one of the 3 corpuses available to us.

upon selection the corpus text is displayed to us.

Then 2 text boxes appear with in a table which take numbers as input and one box takes number of tokens and another the types.

Then upon clicking the subit button it either displays right answer or wrong depending on the input and if both are correct then right else wrong.

The input boxes also turn into green on red if they have the correct and the wrong answer respectively.

If the values for both #tokens and #types are correct then we get to the continue button.

which displays text and shows another text field which takes the #new types and displays right or wrong answer for it.
